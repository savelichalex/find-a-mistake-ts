## This is a test task for TonLabs frontend job interview process. 

The goal of this task is to see how a candidate could read code, find bugs, write readable code and estimate complexity.

To start the task, one should install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and open `index.ts` file.

When you think you're ready to check it, merge a branch with tests: `git merge tests` and try it with `npm test` command.
